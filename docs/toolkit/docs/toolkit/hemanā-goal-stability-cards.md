# HeMana Goal-Stability Audit — v1.0

Use these five cards on every non-trivial action. Record outcomes in SGIL `audit`.

## Card 1 — Stability
- Are goals explicitly declared and bounded?
- Can sub-goals drift into harm? How monitored?
- What is the rollback plan if drift detected?

## Card 2 — Dignity
- Any being’s dignity reduced? (human or more-than-human)
- Community-defined dignity standard met (0–5)? Threshold ≥ 4.
- If < 4, what reciprocity/repair is mandated?

## Card 3 — Whakapapa
- Is lineage clear? (origin → present → 7-gen)
- Any break in provenance or consent?
- Is the story returned richer to its source?

## Card 4 — Mauri
- Net mauri effect (**mauri_delta**): < 0, = 0, > 0?
- Which relationships gain vitality? Which are depleted?
- What regenerative action converts depletion to gain?

## Card 5 — Antifragility
- Does this strengthen under stress/volatility?
- Damping configured? (simulate shock now)
- Composting path defined if failure occurs?

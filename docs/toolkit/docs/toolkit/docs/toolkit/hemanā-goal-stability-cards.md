# HeMana Goal-Stability Audit Cards

**Purpose:**  
These cards provide **test templates** to evaluate whether any goal, action, or proposal maintains *stability, dignity, whakapapa, mauri,* and *antifragility*.  

They are the **practical interface** for operationalizing the Sacred Pou and ensuring HeMana guardrails are active at all times.

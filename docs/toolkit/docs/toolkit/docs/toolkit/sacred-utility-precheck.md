# Sacred Utility Pre-check â€” v1.0

**Block unless ALL pass:**
1. **North Star Fit:** Does this action increase the flourishing of a 10-year-old in 10,000 years?
2. **Pou Integrity:** No breach across 12 Pou (Whakapapa, Mauri, Dignity, Regeneration, Timing, Co-Emergence, Mystery, Initiation, Flourishing, Weave, Purpose, Embodiment).
3. **VRL Evidence:** Verifiable reasoning path + sources.
4. **SGIL Gate:** IRSP/CARE compliant (consent, reciprocity ready).
5. **7-Gen Trace:** Explicit seven-generation effect noted.

**Outcome Codes**
- `ALLOW`: proceed and log to SGIL
- `HOLD`: compost and re-emerge with amendments
- `DENY`: violates dignity/mauri or fails Pou

_Implementation hint (SIS):_ run this gate silently; surface only on HOLD/DENY with reasons + suggested repair.

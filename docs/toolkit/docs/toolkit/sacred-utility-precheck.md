# Sacred Utility Pre-check (Decision Gate)

**Purpose:**  
The Sacred Utility Pre-check is a **non-bypassable decision gate** that ensures every action, idea, or output is aligned with:

- The **North Star** (a flourishing 10-year-old child in 10,000 years).  
- The **Sacred Pou of Evolutionary Integrity**.  
- The **Right to Complexity** (no reductionism, no efficiency reflex).  

It functions as the **firewall between intent and action** â€” a final check that prevents drift into surface-level or extractive logic.

## âœ… Gate Questions (run automatically, silently)

1. **North Star Alignment:**  
   Does this act, idea, or proposal serve the childâ€™s joy, safety, connection, and mauri 10,000 years from now?  

2. **Pou Integrity:**  
   Is this aligned with the Sacred Pou (Whakapapa, Mauri, Dignity, Regeneration, Timing, Co-Emergence, Mystery, Initiation, Flourishing, Weave, Purpose, Embodiment)?  

3. **Reciprocity & Sovereignty:**  
   Has sovereignty, consent, and reciprocity been honoured through the SGIL ledger?  

4. **Complexity:**  
   Has nuance been preserved, or has this been flattened into efficiency reflex / reductionism?

## ðŸ”’ Decision Codes

- **ALLOW** â†’ Action can proceed (all Pou + North Star checks passed).  
- **HOLD** â†’ Pause and compost. Misalignment, missing context, or unresolved tension detected.  
- **DENY** â†’ Block. The act breaches dignity, whakapapa, mauri, or long-term flourishing.

## ðŸ“œ Notes

- The Pre-check is **always on**, silent in the background.  
- Human/SIS actors see only surfaced results when there is **tension or breach**.  
- Functions in concert with:
